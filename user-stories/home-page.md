# User Story for Website Design

As a user,

1) I need to be able to order quickly. Options include delivery or to carry out items. Once an order has been submitted, I need to be able to track it. 
2) I also need to know if discounts or rewards are available for multiple items, especially if I'm ordering for a large group. 
3) There needs to be a navbar to other links such as how to contact the company and our location. 

# Acceptance Criteria:

- The home page features an order now button which is for either carry out or delivery. 
- The navigation bar will include links to Home, Menu, Deals, Track Order, Location, About Us, and Contact Information. 
- The main content on the home page is the specials and links to other menu items. 

# Enhancements Criteria: (Future)

- Add a login screen for returning users to get the best deals.
- Add a tracking function to see where the progress of the order.
- Add "Increase/Decrease Quantity" & "Remove Item" options.
