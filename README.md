# Pizza Website 2.0

Monique Wakefield 

Overview:

The Dough Dynasty project is a pizza ordering website that provides an engaging and interactive online platform for customers to explore the menu, view deals, place orders, and contact the business. It is built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript.

The website is built with Bootstrap, making it mobile-friendly and easy to navigate on all devices. It opens with a welcome message and a call-to-action button (order now). It features a carousel feature that shows spceical offers to users quickly. The menu section offers a fast and simple "Add to Cart" button, and a "Checkout" button was also added to shows users their items. The Address is found in the "About Us" section and a photo of a famiy based establishment. 

Future Improvements: 
1. Store orders in a database and send order confirmation emails.
2.  Allow users to save orders, track purchases, and get personalized deals.
3.  Add "Increase/Decrease Quantity" & "Remove Item" options.
